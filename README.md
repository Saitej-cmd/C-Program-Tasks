DURATION:4 WEEKS
MENTOR:NELLA SANTOSH
During a C programming internship, students work on basic to intermediate-level coding tasks that improve their understanding of core programming concepts. These tasks help interns become familiar with how C is used in real-world scenarios such as software development, embedded systems, data handling, and more. One of the most common areas interns are trained in is file handling, along with various data processing tasks, logic-based programs, and utility development.One of the first and most important tasks interns do is related to file operations in C. This includes learning how to create, read, write, and append data to files. These operations are performed using file pointers and functions such as fopen(), fclose(), fgets(), fputs(), fprintf(), and fscanf(). A basic example includes writing a program to save user input into a file, then later reading that file and displaying the content. This helps interns understand how to store data permanently and retrieve it when needed
